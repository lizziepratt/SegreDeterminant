This project contains a single Macaulay2 script implementing all helper functions needed for computing the Segre determinant 
Seg(3,3), converting to Plücker coordinates, and verifying the answer. 

The code is written for personal research and reproducibility, and not intended for general distribution. 
It accompanies the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09204.
