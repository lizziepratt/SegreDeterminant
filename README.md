This project contains a single Macaulay2 script which computes the Segre determinant Seg(3,3), converting to Plücker coordinates, and verifying the answer. 
It contains several helper functions to be run at the beginning of the file.

The code is written for personal research and reproducibility, and not intended for general distribution. 
It accompanies the paper "The Segre Determinant," which may be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09204.
